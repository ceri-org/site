Although the world is currently on track to reach between 2 and 3 degrees of warming by 2100, this comes with large uncertainties, stemming from both the climate models and uncertainty about which emissions pathway the world will take. These uncertainties are themselves difficult to estimate, owing partly to the fact that climate models are designed to estimate the mean of the temperature distribution, not the tails. This implies a small but uncertain chance of an extreme level of warming, such as warming above 6 degrees based on emissions up to 2100. The impacts of this level of warming are relatively unknown in comparison to lower levels, but may constitute an existential risk. High levels of warming may also provide greater incentive for some nations to unilaterally pursue geoengineering techniques, some of which come with potentially catastrophic levels of risk if mismanaged.

Furthermore, even keeping to 2-3 degrees warming, there may be potential low-probability events which could threaten global food supplies, leading to global catastrophic or even existential risks. Further research is needed to investigate whether these scenarios are plausible.

Finally, climate change has the potential to be an accelerant of other existential risks, such as global pandemics or nuclear war, via changes in ecosystems disturbing dormant pathogens, or by mass migrations leading to global instability or war, making solving global coordination problems significantly harder. Although difficult to estimate, we believe that investigating the likelihood of different mechanisms by which climate change may accelerate other risks could be a productive research project.
