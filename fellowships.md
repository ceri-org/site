Every summer, we run the CERI Summer Research Fellowship (SRF). Successful applicants can contribute to research on the potential perils of nuclear war, transformative artificial intelligence, the climate crisis, biotechnology risks, or more!

The 2022 iteration has an intended length of 10 weeks, with some flexibility. It includes contact with mentor whose research interests align with the fellow's research proposal, a stipend, and free accommodation in Cambridge.
