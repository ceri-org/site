Every summer, we run a fellowship where anyone can contribute to research on the potential perils of nuclear war, transformative artificial intelligence, the climate crises and much more!

Our fellows embark on an eight-week, full-time research programme, with weekly hour-long check-ins with a mentor whose research interests align with the fellow's research proposal.

## Programme Objectives

**Learn:** Help the fellows deepen their understanding of existential risks mitigation and improve their skills in research and communication.

**Collaborate:** Form lasting relationships within a community of people who care deeply about humanityâ€™s future and work to improve it. 

**Motivate:** Encourage constructive participation in events and sharing of knowledge to ensure everyone makes the most of the 8 weeks!

We host cause-area subgroups, speaker events, discussion groups, one-on-ones, and social events throughout the programme to facilitate a broader understanding of existential risks and foster an environment where ideas can be freely shared between academics and junior researchers alike.

We are always looking for the most able and ambitious candidates. If you are interested in being a summer research fellow, or mentor one of our fellows, please do reach out to us at [ceri-contact@srcf.net](mailto:ceri-contact@srcf.net)!
