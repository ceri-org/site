Every summer, we run the CERI Summer Research Fellowship (SRF). Successful applicants can contribute to research on the potential perils of nuclear war, transformative artificial intelligence, the climate crisis, biotechnology risks, or more!

The 2022 iteration has an intended length of 10 weeks, with some flexibility. It includes contact with mentor whose research interests align with the fellow's research proposal, a stipend, and free accommodation in Cambridge.

If you're considering the SRF, apply / reigster interest as soon as possible. Our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hGPPkf) is a good way to stay updated about when applications open. 

## Programme Objectives

**Learn:** Help the fellows deepen their understanding of existential risks mitigation and improve their skills in research and communication.

**Collaborate:** Form lasting relationships within a community of people who care deeply about humanityâ€™s future and work to improve it. 

**Motivate:** Encourage constructive participation in events and sharing of knowledge to ensure everyone makes the most of the 8 weeks!

We host cause-area subgroups, speaker events, discussion groups, one-on-ones, and social events throughout the programme to facilitate a broader understanding of existential risks and foster an environment where ideas can be freely shared between academics and junior researchers alike.

We are always looking for the most able and ambitious candidates. If you are interested in being a summer research fellow, or mentor one of our felllows, and have questions/concerns not addressed by the signup forms, please do reach out to us at [ceri-contact@srcf.net](mailto:ceri-contact@srcf.net)!
