CERI runs many programmes throughout the year that help people get up to speed on existential risks and how to mitigate them. Many of these take the form of discussion groups where participants get together once a week with a facilitator to discuss items in a reading list.

## Existential Risks Introductory Course (ERIC)
The Existential Risks Introductory Course (ERIC) is an 8 week course designed to provide an overview of the field of existential risks, which are risks that could result in a permanent loss of humanity’s future potential. Much of the course will be spent discussing specific risks, such as the anthropogenic risks from nuclear war and climate change, and the risks posed by future technologies like unaligned artificial and engineered pandemics. The course is largely structured around the material in Toby Ord’s book The Precipice, although we attempt to provide several different viewpoints on the field as a whole. Towards the end of the course, we shift to a discussion of what individuals can do to help reduce these risks, and protect the long-run future of humanity.

This course is suitable for everyone, regardless of your background knowledge about existential risks or Effective Altruism. It is also multidisciplinary, spanning fields as disparate as history and anthropology, politics and economics, philosophy, computer science, biology, and statistics.

The first run of ERIC is already in progress, having started in January 2022. More cohorts will be run in the future.


## Effective Climate Change Mitigation (ECCM)

The Effective Climate Change Mitigation seminar programme also runs in a discussion group format. The second iteration is currently ongoing, after the first cohorts successfully finished in December 2021. We expect to run this programme again in the future.


## Artificial General Intelligence Safety Fundamentals (AGISF)

The Artificial General Intelligence Safety Fundamentals programme is something CERI helps run along with EA Cambridge and others. You can see the curriculum [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTm_sT2YQx3mRXQD6J2xD2QJG1c3kHyvX8kQc_IQ0ns/edit#heading=h.dlm795ug69gc). The program has run twice before, and its third iteration is running until March 2022, after which we expect signups to open up again.
