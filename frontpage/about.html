                    <h2>What is an existential risk?</h2>
                    <p>We think of 'existential risks' as events that could permanently and drastically curtail humanityâ€™s potential. These are mostly low probability but high-impact risks.<br></p>
                    <p>Examples of existential risks include extreme runaway climate change, environmental degradation, a nuclear war, a deadly global pandemic, or even accidents from future advances in Artificial Intelligence.<br></p>
