                    <h2>our research fellowships</h2>
                    <p>Every summer, we run a fellowship where anyone can contribute to research on the potential perils of nuclear war, transformative artificial intelligence, the climate crises and much more!<br></p>
                    <p>Our fellows embark on an eight-week, full-time research programme, with weekly hour-long check-ins with a mentor whose research interests align with the fellow's research proposal.<br></p>
                    <h4>Programme objectives</h4>
                    <p><strong>Learn:</strong> Help the fellows deepen their understanding of existential risks mitigation and improve their skills in research and communication.<br><br><strong>Collaborate:</strong> Form lasting relationships within a community of people who care deeply about humanityâ€™s future and work to improve it.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Motivate:</strong> Encourage constructive participation in events and sharing of knowledge to ensure everyone makes the most of the 8 weeks!<br><br></p>
                    <p>We host cause-area subgroups, speaker events, discussion groups, one-on-ones, and social events throughout the programme to facilitate a broader understanding of existential risks and foster an environment where ideas can be freely shared between academics and junior researchers alike.<br></p>
                    <h4></h4>
                    <p>We are always looking for the most able and ambitious candidates. If you are interested in being a summer research fellow, or mentor one of our fellows, please do reach out to us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a><br></p>
